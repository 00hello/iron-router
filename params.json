Its job is to let\r\nyou organize your application by urls. This guide wil start off with some simple\r\nexamples and progress into more advanced concepts.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\nYou can install iron:router using Meteor's package management system:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n> meteor add iron:router\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo update iron:router to the latest version you can use the meteor update\r\ncommand:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n> meteor update iron:router\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\nStart by creating a route in your JavaScript file. By default, routes are\r\ncreated for the client and will run in the browser.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nRouter.route('/', function () {\r\n  this.render('Home');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the user navigates to the url \"/\", the route above will render the template\r\nnamed \"Home\" onto the page.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nRouter.route('/items');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis second route will automatically render a template named \"Items\" or \"items\"\r\nto the page. In simple cases like this, you don't even need to provide a route\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've only created routes that will be run directly in the browser. But\r\nwe can also create server routes. \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nRouter.route('/item', function () {\r\n  var req = this.request;\r\n  var res = this.response;\r\n  res.end('hello from the server\\n');\r\n}, {where: 'server'});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `where: 'server'` option tells the Router this is a server side route.\r\n\r\n## Concepts\r\n\r\n### Server only\r\nIn a typical Web app, you make an http request to a server at a particular url,\r\nlike \"/items/5\", and a router on the server decides which function to invoke for\r\nthat particular route. The function will most likely send some html back to the\r\nbrowser and close the connection.\r\n\r\n### Client only\r\nIn some more modern Web apps you'll use a \"client side\" router like pagejs or\r\nBackbone router. These routers run in the browser, and let you navigate around\r\nan application without making trips to the server by taking advantage of browser\r\nHTML5 features like pushState or url hash fragments. \r\n\r\n### Client and server\r\nIron.Router runs on the client *and* the server. You can define a route that\r\nonly should run on the server, or a route that should only run on the client.\r\nMost of the time you'll create routes on the client. This makes your app really\r\nfast once it's loaded, because as you navigate around the application, you don't\r\nneed to load an entirely new html page.\r\n\r\nThe router is *aware* of all the routes on the client and the server. This means\r\nyou can click a link that takes you to a server route, or it might take you to a\r\nclient route. It also means that on the server, if there is no client route\r\ndefined, we can send a 404 response to the client instead of loading up the\r\nMeteor application.\r\n\r\n## Client Rendering\r\n\r\n## Client Layouts\r\n\r\n## Server Routing\r\n\r\n## Router Parameters\r\n\r\n## Navigation\r\n\r\n## Route Dispatching and Middleware\r\n\r\n## Route Controllers\r\n\r\n## Hooks\r\n\r\n## Plugins\r\n\r\n## Custom Router Rendering\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- Notes\r\n  - Quickstart\r\n    - installing\r\n    - creating some routes\r\n  - Concepts\r\n    - routing on the server\r\n    - routing on the client\r\n    - making a trip back to the server\r\n  - Layouts, yield, contentFor, setting layouts dynamically, etc.\r\n  - Rendering\r\n    - dynamically choosing the layout\r\n    - Rendering templates into regions\r\n    - Setting data contexts\r\n    - Automatic rendering based on the name\r\n  - Server side routing\r\n    - restful routes\r\n    - middleware\r\n    - 404s for no routes found\r\n  - Client side routing\r\n    - client side middleware\r\n  - Creating routes\r\n    - naming routes, or not\r\n    - route functions\r\n    - automatic template lookup\r\n  - Route Parameters\r\n  - Route dispatching\r\n    - What does this mean? controller gets created, anonymous or not\r\n    - client vs. server routes\r\n    - how does the router know when to go to the server or the client?\r\n  - RouteControllers\r\n    - The \"this\" arg inside of your function\r\n    - How do they get created?\r\n    - Creating your own\r\n    - custom action functions and reusing controllers\r\n    - wait and waitOn\r\n    - options like layoutTemplate, template, name, etc.\r\n  - Hooks\r\n    - what are they?\r\n    - how can you use them?\r\n  - Plugins\r\n    - Concept\r\n    - loading, onDataNotFound\r\n    - Creating your own\r\n  - Rendering the Router\r\n    - using the {{> Router}} template helper\r\n    - autoRendering\r\n  - Links and navigation\r\n    - {{pathFor}} and {{urlFor}} helpers\r\n    - Router.go\r\n    - this.redirect\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
