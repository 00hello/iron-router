Breaking Changes:
- waitOn is not concatenated. first one we find we use.
- onData hook is gone since it doesn't really have meaning anymore
- hooks now don't have any pause method use next() instead.
- no automatic error throwing when route not found on client. The user can do
  this by putting a use() at the end.

Feature Tracking:
- route names are inferred from the path now
  '/items/' -> Items
- simpler function based actions
- more granular data contexts (from code or templates)
- contentFor is a lot more powerful
- stateful controllers with get/set methods
- default data context for layout, or individual data contexts for regions.
- onRerun runs any time controller runs again either because of hot code push or
  because of a dep changed.
- 404 tracked on server. if no routes defined the app is not even served.
- 500 errors on server routes.
- set data contexts in layout or render directly. no more setData getData
- ie 8/9 support for hash urls

Proposed Features:
- hooks that run on client/server or both. For now, just use if block
- define "where" options for hooks so they can run on client/server or both
- server OPTIONS requests
- attach multiple routers, allow mounting a completely new router at a different
  location.
- allow multiple routers
