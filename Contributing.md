Bug Reports
-----------

Are very welcome! Keep in mind that a good bug report makes life easier for everyone (including the reporter!) and usually results in bugs being fixed faster.

When reporting a bug, at the least, can you provide:

1. The version of Iron Router + Meteor that you are using.

2. A reproduction in the style of 
  - [Meteor issue reports](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Contributing-to-Meteor#reporting-a-bug-in-meteor)
  - [Chris' video about making reports](https://www.eventedmind.com/feed/github-issues-and-reproductions)

It can seem difficult and a waste of time to make a reproduction, but experience tells us that it ends up saving everyone's time (many, many times reporters end up finding bugs in their own code in producing them. Not to say you aren't looking at a legitimate IR bug!)

Patience is appreciated!
